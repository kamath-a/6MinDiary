# Why?
During stressful periods of my life where I was prone to being more pessimistic, one of the things that helped me maintain my sanity was the 6 Minute Diary by Dominik Spenst. Ordinarily, keeping a diary is a habit that I would struggle to stay consistent with, but the structure here was refreshingly different and one that was manageable to maintain over months. The structure, in case you aren't familiar, is this:

The morning entry:
  - 3 things you are grateful for
  - 3 ways you'll "make today great"
  - A positive affirmation

The evening entry:
  - Your good deed for the day
  - What you learned that day
  - 3 great things that happened that day
  
As much as I love the physical diary itself, I want to create a digital version of it to: a) filter through past entries by dates or keywords, and b) use past entries to gain insights into behavioural patterns and track improvements.
